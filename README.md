## GIT CONVENTIONS

See https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html for basic commit conventions

- Only commit code when it is operational
- Everyone will add independent features on their own feature branch
- All branches will be merged with the main branch once a sprint is complete
- The main branch code will be tested and operational at the end of each sprint
- A tag will be added to the main branch after it is proven operational (The tag will be the name of the sprint)
- Make sure to comment all code that has been written in detail so there is no confusion
- If a bug is discovered in main that needs to be fixed, a temporary branch can be made to fix the bug to merge back into main
